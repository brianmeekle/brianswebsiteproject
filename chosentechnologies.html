        The technologies that I chose to aid me with this website project have helped me out massively and all had their own part to play. I started out with Trello to plan the project, I was originally wanting to draw up a flow chart but due to the time I was allocated I decided this was not capable. With a previous project in which I used Trello I found it to be very effective if I used the kanban method - to describe my development in this project I had four columns (To do, doing, done, reviewing) and each column would be a card for each criteria that had to be met and checklists within each card that once completed would meet these criteria. To me, this dissects and segments everything out in front of me and makes a project a lot easier to understand and deal with. For the project itself, I have been using a coding software called Visual Studio which I think of as a multilingual code editing software as you can use various coding languages together, it understands different coding languages. The most useful feature of Visual Studio is when I may type a piece of coding wrong it will show an error sign which alerts me to go back and work on that piece of coding again, I reckon it helps lower the amount of flaws I would find during any testing. Without it, I would be going back to the beginning again during any final stages which could elongate things and also create stress and panic.
