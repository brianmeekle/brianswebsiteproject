    <h1>Selecting IT systems and software</h1>

    <p>
        The right IT systems and software have to be chosen carefully for a digital project. The overall skill level of the team is something to take into consideration. The software used has to be something that the majority of the team is already familiar with or comfortable with or something that people can be taught to use without using too much of the allocated time. Whilst planning it is best to decide first what features in a piece of software would help you to complete tasks, then select a piece of software or a tool that would help you to meet the criteria mentioned. The interface of the software is also something to be aware of, the more user friendly the software is the less daunting it can appear to be.

        The right communication software has to be selected appropriately too to ensure that the team can collaborate well. Video chat software that has a share screen feature like Zoom help to achieve this goal well, the project can be brought on screen and everyone can have their say on what needs to be changed then this can be changed that very moment instead of having to send files back and forth. Stand up meetings can still occur when working remotely with the use of video chat software.

        List-making applications are also very beneficial in the running of a digital project. When every team member is allowed access they can regularly check where other team members are up to whilst also updating your progress and reminding yourself about anything that you may have to do. Due dates and deadlines can also be mentioned in such applications.[4]
