    <h1>Introduction to digital projects</h1>

        A digital project can be anything that is made on an electronic device and uploaded onto the internet, this can include websites, apps, advertising, and games. There is always a process involved in creating a digital project. To achieve maximum output the tasks involved in a project should be assigned accordingly. 
    </p>
    <p>  
        A project would begin with research into similar projects to what you have in mind, most of this would be done with the aid of the internet. This would be followed by planning how you would go about creating the project, this can be done by drawing out a flowchart or laying out and splitting the process into various stages using tools such as Trello. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        Next would be the actual creation of the project, most digital projects would require someone with the skills needed. A website would need someone who is proficient in HTML coding, games and apps would need those who have the knowledge or experience in programming, and advertising would need people that have the knowledge in creating flyers, posters, or ADs whilst also have the ability to recognise trends. 
    </p>   
    <p> 
        Once the project has been finished everything needs to be evaluated. An analysis of what went right, what went wrong, what tasks were easy or hard to complete, and to do better during the next project. On top of the skills mentioned time management is important for everyone involved in the project as there would most possibly be deadlines to meet. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        Strong communication skills and a keen eye for detail is a must as well as being proficient in technology and tools that will be used. Tools needed include cloud-based technologies where documents can be easily shared, edited, and stored by all members of the team, a good example of this is Google Drive. As communication is a key point towards a team working as efficiently as possible video call software such as Zoom or Hangouts may be needed. [2]
