    <h1>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        There are various constraints that can affect a website such as copyright infringement. This can occur when someone else’s work is used without consent or permission, or when reproductions and derivatives of someone else’s work are made by someone who is not the copyright owner. 
    </p> 

    <p>
        If you are looking to put any art or pictures on a website you are making it is always best to ask the owner for permission or to create something yourself by scratch. You can also use royalty-free images or clip art but be sure to look into it thoroughly before using them as there will more than likely be terms set by the creator or copyright owner. 
    </p>

    <p>  
        You can also get in trouble If you were to copy or use someone else’s text, or even their coding/scripting too. 
    </p> 

    <p>
        Choosing your domain name is something you should be careful about too. If you have been using a legit name for your company for a while it is always good to make sure no one is already using your company name within their domain name as once they have it set in stone there is not much you can do about it. Once you have a domain name that is safe for you to use make sure you register it as your trademark domain name. 
    </p>  
    
    <p>
        Infringement can also happen if you use the trademark of another company. For example, if you use someone else’s logo to create a link to their website from yours this can come back as trademark infringement. [6][7]
