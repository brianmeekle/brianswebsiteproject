    <h3> My background </h3>
    <p>
        Creativity has always played a key part in my life. I started to learn the guitar from age of 11 and decided to take up playing the bass guitar during my second year of secondary school. This led me to join the school Jazz band which amongst playing various gigs in Manchester even did a weekend tour in the Netherlands. I also was in a couple of bands outside of school hours regularly playing parties and gigs at the Red House which was most commonly known for its use as rehearsal rooms in the daytime. From the age of 15, I gained an interest in electronic music and started to learn about music production, and also picking up DJing. From there onwards I played at clubs and parties and even put on events under the name of EQ!

    <h3>My path to Code Nation</h3>
    <p>
        In regards to work, I mainly worked in the industrial sector in Warehouses and factories. I saw an ad for Code Nation when I was deciding a career change was highly needed and had a strong feeling this was something I should pursue. After learning a small amount of coding not long after high school but also working for a couple of months with a company called Join the dots (which involved some coding)  
        I felt this was the right choice to make. So far I have quite enjoyed the course and have learned coding in its own way can be quite creative. There have been parts that have been slightly challenging but this has made my time at Code Nation so far very enjoyable and rewarding. I hope to be able to progress from the course I am on at the moment onto an apprenticeship with a reputable company.
