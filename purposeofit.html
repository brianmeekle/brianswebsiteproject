    <h1>The purpose of IT in modern business</h1>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        Information and Communication Technology is very important in modern business. It is quite rare to come along a business or a company that doesn't regularly use computers and IT systems whether it be on a daily or even once in a blue moon. Creating and storing financial records has progressed from scribblings stored in filing cupboards to spreadsheets and databases, documents are now created in word processing programs proving to be more efficient than typewriters and photocopiers. Each document is tailor-made to a companies taste by using various layout styles, different fonts, and imported art. The way files are stored has been a game-changer for many companies - With the size of a file being smaller than their hard copy counterparts thus taking up a lot less space in the office, plus now files can be backed up online which means if anything bad would occur to the office or its IT equipment then not much would have been lost. Getting files from one company to another has never been faster and cheaper, I know that I would prefer to scan and send something over the internet for free in an instant instead of walking to a post office or post box and paying for the postage of something!
