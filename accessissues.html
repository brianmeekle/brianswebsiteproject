<h1>Access issues that have to be taken into account</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
    When making a website you have to take into consideration accessibility options for people with disabilities. Luckily in the modern IT world that are ways to overcome any barriers for those with lifelong problems.

    <h3>Accessibility for those that are hard of hearing</h3>
<p>
    Deaf people have no problem when it comes to viewing a website but a lot of websites contain more than just text these days and contain quite a lot of media that contains sound. One way to overcome this is to make sure that any videos you have would also contain captions and subtitles.

    <h3>Accessibility for those with eyesight difficulties</h3>
    <p>
    Text versions of audio files should also be accessible for those hard of hearing. For those that are fully blind, there is luckily technology that assists them and reads text off the screen, you need to make sure that the user can navigate your site easily by using just one key such as the tab key then a different key to select a link. Due to not being able to use a mouse or a trackpad, keeping the keys needed to be used by a blind person down a minimum thus making their navigation more bearable. For those that are colour blind, it is good to use contrasting colours and also have text descriptions of any images. For those that are visually impaired but still have some vision benefit from links that stand out from normal text such as being underlined or in italics, donâ€™t restrict anything so that the user can not set their own preferences they should be able to increase or decrease the size of the text.
