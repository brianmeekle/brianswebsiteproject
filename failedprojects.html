    <h1>What causes digital projects to fail?</h1>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        As with most projects, there are risks that are a threat to the completion of digital projects. 
    </p>   
    <h3>Poor planning . . .</h3>
    <p>
        Poor planning is something that causes most digital projects to fail. One thing that should be avoided is being eager to get started with the project itself. Planning helps to ensure that everyone on the team fully understands what the project is about and what needs to be achieved. Poor planning can lead to confusion, poor performance, and tasks being allocated wrongly. 
    </p> 
    
    <h3>Poor choice of tools and software . . .</h3>
    <p>
        Wrongly choosing what tools to use can also be an affecting factor, if the chosen tools use a programming language that the techies aren’t familiar with then this can make it harder for deadlines to be met. It isn’t really essential to get the latest piece of software if there is something already out that people already know how to use and can achieve the desired outcome for the project. Throwing new ideas into the mix after the planning phase can slow things down too as more time may be needed to add in anything extra especially other tasks set have to change around any new ideas. 
    </p>
    <h3>Poor communication . . .</h3>
    <p>
        Poor communication is one to strongly watch for, every member needs to be regularly updated on any progress and changes, and nothing should be left until the last minute to discuss. Regular checkups are beneficial for keeping people motivated and stress levels low. 
    </p> 
    <h3>Poor testing . . .</h3>
    <p>
        Another thing that should be regular is testing, testing should happen throughout the project and not left until the last minute as well. Any flaws should be found and fixed earlier on in the project, this ensures that there is enough time for any problems found towards the end.[3]
