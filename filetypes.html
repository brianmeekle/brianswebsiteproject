    Some file formats are more suitable than others for websites. For a logo for your website, the best format to use would be a .png instead of a .jpeg. Whenever I have tried editing .jpeg files in paint, I would save them then there would be a loss in quality. On the other hand though .jpeg files are best for images on your web pages. Whilst on the subject of visual additions to your web pages remember that short animations should always be .gif files.

    When it comes to uploading text documents to your site it is always best to convert the document into a .pdf file before uploading, this means that no one can edit the document. 
    
    MP3 files are best for any audio you may want on your site, if possible try and use 320 kbps as the lower the bit rate the lower the sound quality. In regards to putting a video on a webpage, you should always upload to youtube as once the upload is created you are given a code which you can use to embed the video onto your webpage, if you feel like uploading a video straight onto your page without youtube you can always go for second best and upload a .mp4 video [10]
